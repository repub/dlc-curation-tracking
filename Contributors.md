## Setting up a new submission

New submissions are entered twice each week by the assistant or designated others from our team if an assistant isn't available. Please use the follwing guidlines to set up an issue for each new submission.

1. Please use the "basic submission" template.

- You will find this by going to the [Issues]() tab and selecting "new issue" which is a green button on the right side of your screen, then select the green "get started" button.

2. Next fill in the link template: 

- **Title**: Please use the first 3-5 words in the submission title.

- **[CreatorLastName] (URL)**: Simply copy/paste the last name of the creator and the URL to the deposit in ScholarSphere. You will leave the brackets and parenthesis, because they create the link. Note: There is no space between the second bracket and first parenthesis.

3. The submission card (Issue) is now ready for the initial review. 

## Initial Review

The assistant or designated other will perform the following review. Please check the box for each affirmative result. You may leave the box blank if result is negative or if you are unsure. Please use the comment feature to leave us details that would be useful for the curator. A curator may reach out to you regarding any unchecked boxes or comments. 

- **Title**

- **Author**

- **Keywords**

- **License & Visibility Match**

- **Publication Date Included**

- **Initial check of file(s) (opens, sensitive info)**

Please also use the **"Attention"** label if you need assistance from others in our group. 

Submissions that are fully checked will then be reviewed by a curator for completion of the issue, or they may be assigned to curators with specialized expertise or ticketed to DCN for further comment or treatments.

You may optionally write appropriate messages or quesitons under a ticket.
