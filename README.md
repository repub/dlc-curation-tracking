# ScholarSphere Curation Tracking

This repository is primarily used to host a GitHub Action that adds new tasks to an Airtable database each day. See:

- [ScholarSphere Submission Review](https://airtable.com/appDpmUjoSLxLZjAz/tblJ9hOdaZePKFg3S/viwKLXfSf5deWJeC7?blocks=hide)

Note, the Sync Airtable action misses some deposits:

- Deposits created before the date that the action uses as a cut-off (30 days ago)
- Embargoed deposits
